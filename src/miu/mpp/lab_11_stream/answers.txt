1) Name the differences between imperative and functional programming
Imperative programming involves giving a series of commands to achieve a desired outcome, focusing on how to do things
step by step. Functional programming, on the other hand, emphasizes the use of functions and immutable data, treating
computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoiding mutable state and side effects.

2) Explain the meaning of declarative programming. Give an example.
Declarative programming focuses on describing what you want to achieve, rather than how to achieve it. An example is
SQL: you declare what data you want to retrieve, and the database system figures out how to retrieve it efficiently.

3) Name the benefits of including functional style programming in Java
Benefits of including functional style programming in Java include improved code readability, better support for
concurrency and parallelism, easier testing due to pure functions, and reduced likelihood of bugs through immutability
and avoiding side effects.
